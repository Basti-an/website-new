# Homepage üè†

Code for my personal homepage @ [sebastian.wiendlocha.org](https://sebastian.wiendlocha.org).
Website currently contains a CV page and a fully-featured semi-modular WebAudio-based Synthesizer.

Build with React, Material-UI for React, NodeJS, ToneJS and Typescript ‚ù§Ô∏è.

Roadmap:

- fix some cross-browser-related bugs
- refactor old hacky code
- ditch [Material UI for React](https://mui.com/) in favor of good old SCSS or Tailwind maybe
- ditch React for [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/)
